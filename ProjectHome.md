Python based simulation of MIMO contains following principles:
1. Transmitter modeling with appropriate ways of modulation and coding.
2. Modeling the kernel MIMO time-variant discrete channel with AGWN(Additive white Gaussian noise).
3. Modeling the kernel MIMO time-variant discrete channel with Rayleigh fading.
4. Receiver modeling conversely with the estimation of BER(Bit Error Rate)

Note: In fact, i find that no project in Google Code Project or   Sourceforge.net discusses about the MIMO simulation by the outstanding language of Python. So i hope with my support, more and more people will join the Python-based movement in MIMO field.
