-- A *big* change in the maximum-likelihood receiver has resulted in a
   considerable reduction of its complexity. We don't return the
   closest-point to the original (QAM) lattice; we stay in the H3 lattice
   and that saves as one pseudoinverse and several matrix operations per
   block. For the moment it is necessary to see the code to understand
   the details.

-- The code is undergoing a beautification. We have already improved the
   legibility of several functions. This is an undergoing effort that will
   continue for the forseeable future.

-- Along with the code readability changes, we're updating and improving
   the comments in the code. Several were stale (we changed the code
   without updating the comments). This effort will also continue for some
   time.
