This is the MSIM Mimosim simulator. Please see the file mimosim.txt
for documentation on how to make it work. See the file INSTALL for
help on installation; see the file LICENSE for license details. The
file CHANGELOG contains the list of changes for each version.

Requirements:

This software has been tested to run on Linux systems. The code,
however, is nothing fancy and will probably compile on a number of
different platforms. This has not been tested, though.

The program has been tested with GNU Make and GCC versions 3.3.1, 3.3.3 
and 2.95.3.

The program needs the GNU Scientific Library to compile and run. This
library can be obtained at:

   http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/

This library is used to generate random numbers. If you have your
own random number generators, simply look for functions that start
with gsl* and replace them with your own functions.
