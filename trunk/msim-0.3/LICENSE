This license applies to the MSIM simulator. MSIM contains many
algorithms that are common knowledge and have been published in books,
journal articles, and the internet. I don't claim copyright on any
algorithm present on this software; I only claim copyright on my
particular implementation of them.

The reason for releasing this code under this license is very simple. I
want to encourage anyone interested in this software to contribute to
its improvement. By licensing it under an open-source license, I want to
encourage people to not keep their modifications to themselves, but
instead to contribute them. By joining efforts we can improve this
software for the benefit of all.

Please note that this software is being released under the MIT license.

The file nr_function.c contains code that originally appeared in the
