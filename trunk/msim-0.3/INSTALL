To compile the MSIM simulator simply type:

make <enter>

This will create binary "mimosim" and directory "results",
which is needed for mimosim to run.

If you later move "mimosim" to another directory, remember to 
move the directory "results" as well.

If you want to compile the software with specific optimizations,
put them in the CFLAGS environmental variable.

Please see the file README for dependency requirements.
